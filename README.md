# FaceMaskDetection
Detecting Face Mask by fine tuning FasterRCNN Pytorch

# Introduction
This application detects wheather a person is wearing mask/ not wearing mask/ wearing mask incorrectly.

# Steps
1. Train the model by executing the ipython notebook on google colab
2. Download the model to the same directory
3. Execute the face_mask.py to perform inference on input stream from camera

# Output
## With Mask
<img src=with_mask.png height=500 width=500>

## Without Mask
<img src=without_mask.png height=500 width=500>

## Incorrect Mask
<img src=incorrect_mask.png height=500 width=500>
